# packet-sniffer
# Simple packet sniffer tool using scapy

# The idea is to ask for the network interface, enter the number of packets to capture, and the duration of the the sniffing.
# From there, the user can filter by desired protocol, creating a log file and then writing all packets detected within the parameters to that log file.

# All of these parameters are fully customisable by the user and editable within the code itself with special cases for exception handling.
